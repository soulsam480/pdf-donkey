Click on the **Create** button, then provide the `Title` for the template and below that provide a `basic template` e.g.

```html
<h1>My Template</h1>
```

This is done to prevent spamming of new templates which will create unnecessary data. Then click submit to create the template.

Then you will be redirected to a page where you can customize that template.

## Modes for templates

We provide two modes to make a PDF :

1. Rich text mode
2. Code mode

### Rich text mode

In this mode you can edit and write using the rich text editor.

- In this mode you write anything like in a normal text-area field, further you can edit it and give it styling according to your choice.

- You can also add images, links, media files in this mode directly from the `insert` tab.

### Code mode

In this mode you can edit and write using the `HTML` and custom `CSS`.

- You have to write the structure in HTML like any other webpages.
- To style the PDF's contents, you can write your own CSS for it. You can use inline `style` and click on the settings button give `class` and `id` as selectors to the elements.
